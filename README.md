Still working out the best organization but the basic idea of this repo is to stop reinventing the wheel. I should be able to start a new job on a new computer with a fresh Altium install and be immediately productive.

# Library
Everything in this directory uses the DbLib format, using csv files as the database. I may move to SQL at some point if it seems necessary.

# Scripts
Doesn't exist yet

# Templates
Will eventually contain useful skeleton schematic, layout, project files etc.
